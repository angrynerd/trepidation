# Trepidation

Trepidation A First Person Shooter Based On The Q3 Engine
Trepidation is a first person shooter set in the future based on the GPL IOQ3 Quake Engine. Trepidation features all new weapons, maps and vehicles.. Currently planned game types are DM, CTF, Last Man Standing and 2 others to be announced.



From the original website circa 2007:
The code work thus far has been mostly bringing the Q3 source up to speed with modern day games. Some of the highlights include:
Engine: Multiple Master Server Support, MD4/MDR Model Support and MP3 Support, Surround Sound. 
Game: Unlagged Technology, MD4/MDR Model Support, HTTP/FTP Download redirection (no more slow downloads), Altered physics, Alt Fire for All Weapons, MAC OS/X Support, A Zoom function that is actually useful, ladder support, support for breakable objects in maps, a few new weapon functions and an instagib option for all game types. 

We are planning some unique options for mappers such as the ability to specify different gravity for different parts of any given map as well as map level player speed control. 

A Player Class system has been partially implemented that is completely controlled by configuration files, you can specify practically anything about any given player class in these files. An early draft of one of these configurations can be found here . 

New GameTypes
Trepidation introduces several new gametypes as well as some 'oldies, but goodies'.  Current gametypes include, Free For All, Team Deathmatch, Tourney, Capture The Flag,  Survival (A last man standing game), Arsenal; A game where the object is not to run out of weapons and the Trepidation gametype, a team based game with buildable objects where the object is not to let the other team destroy your Master Controller/Reactor (See the Manual for Details), .  Most gametypes have an instagib option.

Trepidation will introduce new aspects to the physics of the Q3 engine, The new physics are geared towards trick jumping with weapons and high speed jumping. Trepidation also introduces air and land vehicles, something that hasn't been seen in similar projects. Trepidation will also include an improved 'unlagged' network code based on unlagged 2.0 but more finely tuned to the new physics present. The project will utilize a modified version of the GPL dpmaster for the 'master' server code base.

The game will have ports for *nix, *BSD, Win32 and possibly an OSX port. OpenAL will be used for sound. Surround sound supported. AVI video capture of demos, Ogg Vorbis & MP3 support. Much improved QVM tools and a well documented SDK for mod authors. MinGW compilation support on Windows and cross-compilation on Linux, which is already included in the IOQ3 Project.
